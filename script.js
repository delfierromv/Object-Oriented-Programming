//ENCAPSULATION: PRIVATE CLASS FIELDS AND METHODS

//1. Public fields (ex the movements & locale field)

//3. Public methods- (public interface)
//4. Private methods- very useful to hide the implementation details from the outside.
//(there is also the static version by using the static keyword for the other 4 features above so really there are 8 in total)

  //NOTE: Fields have to be outside of any method even including the constructor

  //1. PUBLIC FIELDS- available on instances and not on prototype
  locale = navigator.language;
  // _movements = [];

  //2. PRIVATE FIELDS- available on instances and not on prototype
  #movements = [];
  #pin; //since we cannot declare any fields within methods, then in order to make the property PRIVATE, you must declare it outside of the methods before and don't set it to anything so its essentially like creating an empty variable. So in the beginning this will be set to undefined.

    //PROTECTED PROPERTY
    // this._pin = pin;

    this.#pin = pin;

//console.log(acc1.#pin); //DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WE CANNOT ACCESS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE SINCE IT IS A PRIVATE FIELD




//ENCAPSULATION MEANS TO KEEP SOME PROPERTIES AND METHODS PRIVATE INSIDE THE CLASS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE THE CLASS. THEN THE REST OF THE METHODS ARE BASICALLY EXPOSED AS A PUBLIC INTERFACE WHICH WE CAN ALSO CALL API !!!!!!!!!!!

//Two reasons why we need encapsulation and data privacy
//1.prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate our data inside the class
//2. When we expose only a small interface, soo a small API consisting only of a few public methods, then we can change all the other internal methods with more confidence because we can be sure that external code does not rely on these private methods, therefore our code will not break when we do internal changes.

//However, JavaScript classes actually do not yet support real data privacy and encapsulation, but we can fake encapsulation by simply using a convention.

//CHAINING METHODS

acc1.deposit(300).deposit(500).withdraw(35).requestLoan(25000).withdraw(4000);

This will only work if within the deposit,withdraw, and requestLoan method, you return the account so you must return "this" which will make the methods chainable.
